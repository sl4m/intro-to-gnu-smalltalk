### Smalltalk to underpin "new world" of computing exemplified by "humanâ€“computer symbiosis"

* "Human-Computer Symbiosis" - term used in the 60's, primarily by ARPA community
* Smalltalk was part of the larger pursuit called personal computing

## Smalltalk development began as early as 1969

* Smalltalk-71, 72 released internally
* Smalltalk-76 introduce the development environment (IDE)
* Smalltalk-80 introduced metaclasses
* General availability in 1983 as `Smalltalk-80 Version 2`
* Smalltalk typically refers to the programming environment

## Xerox PARC formed ParcPlace Systems

* a spin-off company to bring Smalltalk to the market
* Digitalk was another company bringing Smalltalk to Windows/IBM's OS/2
* ParcPlace was focused on UNIX/Sun Microsystem

## In 1995, those two companies merged

* Company renamed to ParcPlace-Digitalk
* Then in 1997, rebranded as ObjectShare
* Two years later, RIP

### In no particular order

* Java was taking over the world
* VM concept too futuristic in its day and had substantial memory needs
* Fragmentation in the Smalltalk implementations (like Lisp)
* Source Control Repository (difficult to share code)
* "...it was just too easy to make a mess" - [Uncle Bob Martin](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/8482)

* Pharo
* GNU Smalltalk
* Squeak
* [redline.st](https://github.com/jamesladd/redline-smalltalk) (Smalltalk on the JVM)
* Cincom's VisualWorks and ObjectStudio
* Gemstone (heard of MagLev?)
* Object Arts' Dolphin Smalltalk
